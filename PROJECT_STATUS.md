# Project Status

## Current State: Experimental (v0.1.0)

Simpulse is an **experimental** tool for adjusting Lean 4 simp rule priorities based on usage frequency patterns.

### What Works
- ✅ Basic simp rule detection and parsing
- ✅ Frequency-based priority adjustment
- ✅ CLI interface with check/optimize commands
- ✅ File backup before modifications

### Known Limitations
- ⚠️ Performance improvements are theoretical estimates, not measured
- ⚠️ No integration with Lean's actual profiling tools
- ⚠️ Limited testing on real-world projects
- ⚠️ May not work with all Lean 4 syntax variations

### Development Status
- CI/CD: ✅ Working
- Test Coverage: Limited (core functionality only)
- Documentation: Basic usage guide in README
- Package: Available via pip (experimental)

### Future Work
- Integrate with Lean 4's trace profiler for actual measurements
- Validate performance claims with real benchmarks
- Expand test coverage
- Support more complex simp rule patterns

**Note**: This tool is a research prototype and should not be used in production without thorough testing.
