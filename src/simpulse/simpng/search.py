    Neural proof search - NOT IMPLEMENTED.

    Previous version claimed to implement:
    - Beam search through "semantic embedding space"
    - Neural similarity-guided rule selection
    - Learned heuristics for proof exploration
    - Multi-step proof planning

    Reality: No neural networks existed, no actual proof search implementation.

    Real implementation would require:

    1. **Neural Architecture**:
       - Graph neural networks for goal representations
       - Attention mechanisms for rule selection
       - Reinforcement learning for search strategy

    2. **Training Data**:
       - Large corpus of successful Lean proofs
       - Goal-tactic-outcome triples
       - Proof search traces with rewards

    3. **Search Algorithm**:
       - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
       - A* search with learned heuristics
       - Beam search with neural scoring
