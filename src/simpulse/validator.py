    Validates optimizations - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED.

    Current implementation:
    - ✅ Syntax validation (runs `lean --check`)
    - ❌ Performance validation (no real optimization measurement)
    - ❌ Correctness validation (doesn't verify optimization preserves semantics)

    Real optimization validation would require:

    1. **Semantic Equivalence**:
       - Prove that optimized and original rules are logically equivalent
       - Use Lean's built-in proof checking
       - Verify no behavior changes in proof search

    2. **Performance Measurement**:
       - Instrument simp tactic execution
       - Measure rule application counts and timing
       - Compare optimization impact on real proofs

    3. **Regression Testing**:
       - Test on large corpus of existing proofs
       - Ensure no proof breaks after optimization
       - Validate compilation time improvements
