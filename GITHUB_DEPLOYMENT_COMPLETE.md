## View Test Results

The GitHub Actions workflow will run automatically. Check the results at:
https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse/actions

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor CI/CD**: Watch for the test results at the Actions tab
2. **Install Lean 4**: Required for empirical validation
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh
   ```
3. **Run Real Tests**: Execute `./test_simpulse_now.sh` locally
4. **Create Release**: Once tests pass, create a GitHub release
5. **Publish to PyPI**: Use `scripts/prepare_pypi_release.py`
