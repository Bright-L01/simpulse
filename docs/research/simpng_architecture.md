# SimpNG Architecture - The Future of Theorem Proving

## Vision

SimpNG (Simp Next Generation) represents a complete paradigm shift in automated theorem proving, moving from syntactic pattern matching to semantic understanding using deep learning.

## Revolutionary Concepts

### 1. Semantic Embeddings
- **Traditional**: Syntactic pattern matching on AST structures
- **SimpNG**: High-dimensional semantic embeddings that capture mathematical meaning
- **Impact**: Rules with similar *meaning* are discovered automatically

### 2. Neural Proof Search
- **Traditional**: Exhaustive search through rule combinations
- **SimpNG**: Beam search guided by learned heuristics in embedding space
- **Impact**: Orders of magnitude faster proof discovery

### 3. Self-Learning System
- **Traditional**: Static rule priorities
- **SimpNG**: Continuous learning from every proof attempt
- **Impact**: System improves automatically over time
