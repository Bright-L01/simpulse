## Risk Mitigation

### Low User Adoption
- **Risk**: Insufficient user interest despite technical excellence
- **Mitigation**: Targeted outreach to specific Lean 4 user groups, emphasize concrete performance benefits

### Maintainer Burnout
- **Risk**: Unsustainable response expectations
- **Mitigation**: Build contributor team early, establish clear boundaries, automate where possible

### Technical Debt from Rapid Iteration
- **Risk**: Code quality degradation from fast releases
- **Mitigation**: Maintain comprehensive test suite, require reviews for all changes

## Strategic Importance

Phase 14 is crucial for:

1. **Market Validation**: Confirms whether performance improvements solve real user problems
2. **Community Foundation**: Establishes the user base needed for long-term project sustainability
3. **Product-Market Fit**: Real feedback drives feature priorities and roadmap refinement
4. **Network Effects**: Early adopters become advocates, creating organic growth

## Success Enables Future Phases
