## 🔄 Response Workflow

### 1. Initial Issue Processing (Within 2 hours)

**For every new issue:**
1. **Add appropriate labels** (`bug`, `beta-feedback`, `enhancement`, etc.)
2. **Assign priority** (P0-P3)
3. **Initial response** acknowledging the issue
4. **Request missing info** if needed (use templates below)
5. **Add to tracking spreadsheet**

### 2. Bug Investigation (Same day for P0/P1)

**Investigation checklist:**
- [ ] Can reproduce locally?
- [ ] Common platform issue or edge case?
- [ ] Related to other reported issues?
- [ ] Requires immediate fix or can wait for beta.2?
- [ ] Workaround available?

### 3. User Communication

**For bugs:**
- Confirm reproduction
- Provide workaround if available
- Set timeline for fix
- Ask for additional testing if needed

**For feedback:**
- Thank user for testing
- Extract key insights
- Ask clarifying questions
- Confirm prediction accuracy

### 4. Resolution and Follow-up

**After fixing:**
- Notify user of fix
- Request verification
- Ask if anything else needed
- Update tracking metrics

## 📝 Response Templates

### Installation Issues

```markdown
Thanks for testing Simpulse! Sorry you're having installation trouble.

This looks like [specific issue description]. Here are some steps to try:

1. [Specific solution steps]
2. [Alternative approach]
3. [Workaround if needed]

If these don't work, could you share:
- Output of `python --version` and `pip --version`
- Your OS version
- Full error message from installation

I'll get this resolved quickly - beta testing should be smooth!
```

### Bug Reports

```markdown
Thanks for the detailed bug report! This is helpful.

I can [reproduce/need more info to reproduce] this issue. 

[If reproducible:]
I've confirmed this is a bug. Working on a fix and should have it ready within [timeline]. I'll update you as soon as it's resolved.

[If need more info:]
To help debug this, could you run:
```bash
simpulse --debug [failing command]
```
and share the output?

Also helpful: [any specific additional info needed]

This is exactly the kind of feedback that makes beta testing valuable!
```

### Performance Feedback

```markdown
This is fantastic feedback - exactly what we need to validate the tool!

[If positive results:]
Great to hear the [X%] speedup matches our prediction! This confirms that the performance guarantee system is working correctly for [project type] projects.

[If negative results:]
Thanks for the honest feedback. This is actually valuable data - we want to understand when the tool doesn't help as much as when it does.

A few questions:
- Did the `simpulse guarantee` command predict this outcome correctly?
- Were there any warning signs in the analysis?
- Would you recommend we adjust our prediction algorithm?

Your results help us improve the accuracy of future recommendations.
```

### Feature Requests

```markdown
Thanks for the suggestion! This is an interesting idea.

[If fits beta scope:]
This could definitely improve the beta experience. Let me see about getting this into beta.2.

[If future roadmap:]
This is a great suggestion for the stable release. I'm adding it to our roadmap for consideration after we complete the beta validation.

[If out of scope:]
This is outside the current scope of Simpulse (which focuses specifically on simp rule optimization), but I appreciate the suggestion.

Would you be willing to test this feature if we implement it?
```
