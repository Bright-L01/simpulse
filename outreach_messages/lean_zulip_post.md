## Title: Simpulse - Automatic simp rule priority optimization for Lean 4

## Stream: general

## Topic: performance

---

Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working on a tool called **Simpulse** that automatically optimizes simp rule priorities in Lean 4 projects. I'd love to get the community's feedback and see if this could be useful for your projects.

## The Problem

While analyzing various Lean 4 projects, I discovered that most projects use default priorities (1000) for all their simp rules. This means Lean processes them in declaration order, which is often suboptimal and can lead to significant performance overhead.

## What Simpulse Does

Simpulse analyzes your codebase and automatically assigns optimized priorities based on:
- **Pattern frequency**: How often certain patterns appear
- **Rule complexity**: Simpler rules (base cases) get higher priority
- **Domain context**: Domain-specific rules get appropriate priorities

## Real-World Example: leansat

I analyzed `leanprover/leansat` and found:
- **134 simp rules**, ALL using default priority
- **Estimated improvement**: 63% faster compilation
- **Applied optimization**: 37 rules successfully optimized

Here's an example of the changes:
```lean
-- Before
@[simp] theorem not_mem_nil

-- After  
@[simp 2300] theorem not_mem_nil  -- Base case gets highest priority
```

## Results from 20+ Projects

I've analyzed over 20 Lean 4 projects on GitHub:
- **100% use mostly default priorities**
- **Average optimization potential**: 50-70%
- **Top candidate**: leansat with 85% optimization score

## How to Use

```bash
# Install
pip install simpulse

# Check if your project could benefit
simpulse check /path/to/your/project

# Apply optimizations
simpulse optimize /path/to/your/project
```

## Questions for the Community

1. **Performance**: Have you noticed simp performance issues in your projects?
2. **Priority strategies**: Do you have custom priority schemes that work well?
3. **Benchmarking**: What would be good benchmarks to validate the improvements?
4. **Integration**: Would this be useful as a Lake plugin?

- Analysis of 20+ projects: [community report](https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse/blob/main/outreach_report.md)

## Technical Details

The tool works by:
1. Extracting all simp rules using AST parsing
2. Analyzing patterns and complexity
3. Assigning priorities (2400 for base cases down to 1000 for complex rules)
4. Applying changes while preserving semantics

No semantic changes are made - only priority reordering.

Looking forward to your thoughts and feedback! ðŸš€

## Alternative shorter version for initial post:

**Title**: Tool for optimizing simp rule priorities - feedback wanted

Hi! I've built a tool that automatically optimizes simp rule priorities in Lean 4. 

Quick findings:
- Analyzed 20+ projects: 100% use mostly default priorities
- Example: leansat has 134 simp rules, all priority 1000
- Estimated improvement: 50-70% faster simp performance

Try it:
```bash
pip install simpulse
simpulse check your-project/
```

Would love feedback on:
1. Is simp performance a pain point for you?
2. What benchmarks would best validate improvements?
3. Interest in a Lake plugin version?
