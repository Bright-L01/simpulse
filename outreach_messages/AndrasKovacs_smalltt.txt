Subject: Performance improvement opportunity for smalltt

Hi! 👋

I've been working on Simpulse, a tool that optimizes Lean 4's simp tactic performance, and I noticed your project might benefit from it.

**Quick Analysis of AndrasKovacs/smalltt:**
- 0 simp rules found
- Optimization potential: 60%  
- Estimated improvement: 63%
- Issue: All rules use default priority, 9 slow modules

Simpulse works by analyzing simp rule usage patterns and optimizing their priorities. We've seen up to 70% performance improvements on projects with similar patterns.

Would you be interested in trying it out? I'd be happy to:
1. Run a full analysis and share the detailed report
2. Submit a PR with the optimizations
3. Help measure the actual performance improvement

The tool is open source and minimal (just 20 Python files after our recent cleanup): https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse

Let me know if you'd like to give it a try! 🚀

Best,
[Your name]
