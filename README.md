**Advanced Lean 4 simp optimization using real diagnostic data from Lean 4.8.0+**

Evidence-based optimization with performance validation, powered by Lean's built-in diagnostics infrastructure.

## ✨ What's New in 2.0

- **Lake build system integration** - Works with real Lean 4 projects
- **Hybrid analysis system** - Lake diagnostics + pattern-based fallback
- **Real diagnostic data** from Lean 4.8.0+ `set_option diagnostics true`
- **Performance validation** with actual timing measurements  
- **Evidence-based recommendations** instead of theoretical estimates
- **Automatic loop detection** and inefficient theorem identification
- **Professional CLI** with comprehensive analysis reporting

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Integrates with Lake build system** for real project compilation
2. **Collects diagnostic data** from actual Lean 4.8.0+ compilation
3. **Falls back to pattern analysis** when diagnostic data unavailable
4. **Analyzes simp theorem efficiency** from real usage statistics  
5. **Generates evidence-based recommendations** with confidence scores
6. **Validates optimizations** with before/after performance measurement
7. **Reports actual improvements** with measurable results

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install 
pip install simpulse

# Analyze project with real diagnostic data
simpulse analyze my-lean-project/

# Preview evidence-based optimizations  
simpulse preview my-lean-project/

# Optimize with performance validation
simpulse optimize my-lean-project/

# Benchmark current performance
simpulse benchmark my-lean-project/
```

## 📊 Real Example Output

```bash
$ simpulse analyze lean4-project/

# Shows Lake integration attempt + fallback (verbose mode)
2025-07-16 04:05:58,297 - Lake integration available
2025-07-16 04:06:43,002 - Lake collection returned no data, trying fallback...
2025-07-16 04:06:43,711 - Found 3 simp rules in codebase
```

**Note**: The tool is designed for projects with substantial simp usage. Simple test projects may not show dramatic results. For best results, use with complex Lean 4 projects that make extensive use of simp tactics.

## 🔬 Evidence-Based Analysis

Unlike tools that make theoretical estimates, Simpulse 2.0 uses **real data** from Lean's diagnostic system:

### Real Usage Statistics
```
[simp] used theorems (max: 250, num: 2):
  frequently_used_theorem ↦ 150
  rarely_used_theorem ↦ 3
[simp] tried theorems (max: 300, num: 2):  
  frequently_used_theorem ↦ 152, succeeded: 150
  rarely_used_theorem ↦ 89, succeeded: 3
```

### Evidence-Based Recommendations
- **High confidence** (80-100%): Strong usage data, clear optimization opportunity
- **Medium confidence** (50-79%): Moderate evidence, likely beneficial
- **Low confidence** (<50%): Weak evidence, proceed with caution

### Performance Validation
Every optimization is validated with actual compilation timing:
- **Before**: Baseline performance measurement
- **After**: Optimized performance measurement  
- **Result**: Measured improvement percentage
- **Validation**: Changes reverted if improvement < threshold

## 🛠️ Advanced Commands

### Analysis Commands
```bash
# Deep analysis with detailed reporting
simpulse analyze my-project/ --max-files 50

# Preview optimizations at different confidence levels
simpulse preview my-project/ --confidence-threshold 80 --detailed

# Benchmark with multiple runs for accuracy  
simpulse benchmark my-project/ --runs 5
```

### Optimization Commands
```bash
# Optimize with custom confidence threshold
simpulse optimize my-project/ --confidence-threshold 75

# Skip performance validation (faster but less safe)
simpulse optimize my-project/ --no-validation

# Require higher improvement threshold for validation
simpulse optimize my-project/ --min-improvement 10.0
```

### Output and Integration
```bash
# Save analysis results to JSON
simpulse analyze my-project/ --output analysis.json

# Quiet mode for scripting
simpulse optimize my-project/ --quiet

# Verbose mode for debugging
simpulse analyze my-project/ --verbose
```

## 📋 Requirements

- **Lean 4.7.0+** (4.8.0+ recommended for enhanced diagnostic features)
- **Python 3.10+** 
- **Access to `lean` executable** in PATH
- **Lake build system** (included with Lean 4.7.0+)

## 🔍 How Diagnostic Analysis Works

1. **Enables diagnostics** with `set_option diagnostics true`
2. **Compiles target files** to generate usage statistics
3. **Parses diagnostic output** to extract theorem performance data
4. **Identifies patterns** like looping lemmas and inefficient theorems
5. **Generates recommendations** based on statistical analysis

## ⚡ Performance Validation Process

1. **Baseline measurement**: Records original compilation times
2. **Apply optimizations**: Makes evidence-based changes
3. **Optimized measurement**: Records new compilation times  
4. **Statistical validation**: Verifies improvement meets threshold
5. **Auto-revert**: Restores original if validation fails

## 🎯 Optimization Types

| Type | Description | Evidence Required |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Priority Increase** | Boost priority for frequently used theorems | High usage + success rate |
| **Priority Decrease** | Lower priority for inefficient theorems | High tried + low success rate |
| **Loop Detection** | Identify potential theorem loops | Excessive usage patterns |
| **Inefficient Removal** | Remove simp attribute from failing theorems | Very low success rates |

## 📈 Success Metrics

- **Evidence-based**: All recommendations backed by real usage data
- **Measurable**: Performance validated with actual timing
- **Conservative**: Only applies high-confidence optimizations by default
- **Transparent**: Full reporting of analysis and validation results

## 🔬 Research Foundation

Built on extensive research of Lean 4 simp optimization:
- Analysis of Lean 4.8.0+ diagnostic capabilities
- Study of common simp performance patterns  
- Integration with Lean's built-in profiling tools
- Validation against real-world Lean projects

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Lean 4.7.0+ required** (4.8.0+ recommended for enhanced diagnostics)
- **Lake integration** may fail with complex dependencies - falls back to pattern analysis
- **Performance validation recommended** for production use
- **Backup files automatically** before applying changes
- **Results are project-specific** - patterns vary by codebase
- **Best results on projects with substantial simp usage** - simple projects may show minimal optimization opportunities
