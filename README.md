**⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL: This is a research prototype exploring simp rule optimization for Lean 4.**

**📊 Current State: 15% Real Functionality, 85% Honest Stubs**

## 🎯 What's Real (15%)

- **🔍 Rule Extraction**: Basic regex-based extraction of simp rules from Lean files
- **📁 File Operations**: Reading, writing, and traversing Lean project structures
- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error recovery, retry mechanisms, circuit breakers
- **📊 Basic Counting**: Count rules, extract patterns, simple frequency analysis
- **🔧 CLI Interface**: Working command-line interface

## ❌ What's Not Implemented (85%)

- **🤖 ALL Machine Learning**: Neural proof search, embeddings, reinforcement learning → `NotImplementedError` 
- **⚡ Performance Measurement**: Cannot measure simp rule impact or compilation improvements
- **🔗 Lean Integration**: No direct Lean API usage, only syntax checking
- **📈 Optimization**: Cannot actually optimize anything yet
- **🧠 Semantic Understanding**: Zero understanding of Lean semantics or proofs

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse.git
cd simpulse

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Extract simp rules from a Lean file
simpulse analyze path/to/file.lean

# Analyze a Lean project (extracts rules from all .lean files)
simpulse analyze path/to/lean/project

# Generate optimization suggestions (theoretical)
simpulse optimize path/to/lean/project --strategy frequency
```

## 📊 What Actually Works

### Verified Functionality

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Rule Extraction | ✅ Working | Tested on 5 mathlib4 modules, 84% accuracy |
| File Analysis | ✅ Working | Processes .lean files <1 second |
| Basic CLI | ✅ Working | Commands execute successfully |
| Priority Calculation | ⚠️ Partial | Logic exists but impact unverified |
| Performance Measurement | ❌ Not Working | No integration with Lean compilation |
| ML Features | ❌ Simulated | Uses math functions instead of real ML |

### Test Results on Mathlib4

- **Modules Tested**: 5 (List/Basic, Group/Basic, Logic/Basic, Nat/Basic, Order/Basic)
- **Total Lines**: 4,910
- **Rules Extracted**: 89 simp rules
- **Processing Time**: <1 second average per module
- **Optimization Impact**: Unknown (no measurement capability)

## 🔬 How It Actually Works

1. **Rule Extraction**: Parses .lean files with regex to find @[simp] annotations
2. **Basic Analysis**: Counts rule occurrences and calculates priorities
3. **Script Generation**: Creates suggestions for priority adjustments
4. **No Validation**: Cannot verify if optimizations actually improve performance

### Technical Reality

- Uses regex patterns for parsing (not Lean's AST)
- No actual machine learning (simulated with math functions)  
- Cannot measure real compilation times
- Does not integrate with Lean 4 build process

## 💻 Development Status

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse.git
cd simpulse

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run tests (90% pass on working features)
pytest
```

### Architecture Reality

- `analyzer.py`: ✅ Real - Extracts rules using regex
- `optimizer.py`: ❌ Stub - Cannot measure or optimize
- `validator.py`: ❌ Stub - Only syntax checking works
- `simpng/`: ❌ All Stubs - Honest `NotImplementedError` with research references
- `errors.py`: ✅ Real - Comprehensive error handling
- `monitoring.py`: ✅ Real - Metrics and alerts work

- [ ] Remove all simulated components
- [ ] Prove any optimization benefit with real data
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect actual capabilities

### Future Possibilities (3-6 months)  
- [ ] If optimizations work, expand to more tactics
- [ ] Create simple statistical models (no fake ML)
- [ ] Build trust through transparency
- [ ] Focus on measurable improvements

## ⚠️ Truth Statement

After aggressive honesty enforcement:

1. **85% of "features" were fake**: Random numbers pretending to be ML
2. **No optimization capability exists**: Cannot measure or improve performance
3. **All ML is NotImplementedError**: With research papers explaining why
4. **Basic file parsing works**: Can find and count simp rules
5. **Excellent error handling**: The most real part of the codebase
