## ‚ö° Optimization Results (if you proceeded)

**Did you proceed with optimization?** [Yes/No]
**If No, why not?** [recommendation was skip / too risky / other]

**If Yes, please continue:**

### Before Optimization:
```bash
# Run this before optimization to get baseline
$ time lean YourSlowestFile.lean
# Paste timing results (try 3 times for accuracy)
Run 1: real Xm Ys
Run 2: real Xm Ys  
Run 3: real Xm Ys
Average: [calculate average]
```

### Optimization Process:
```bash
$ simpulse optimize --apply /path/to/your/project
# Paste output here
```

**Did optimization complete successfully?** [Yes/No]
**If No, what error occurred?**

### After Optimization:
```bash
# Test same file after optimization
$ time lean YourSlowestFile.lean  
# Paste timing results (try 3 times for accuracy)
Run 1: real Xm Ys
Run 2: real Xm Ys
Run 3: real Xm Ys
Average: [calculate average]
```

**Actual improvement:** [X% faster/slower/no change]

**Did actual results match the prediction?** [Yes/No/Partially]

## üìä Project-Specific Results

**Project Details:**
- Number of `@[simp]` rules found: [from `simpulse check` output]
- Rules that could be optimized:
- Primary types of simp rules: [arithmetic/lists/strings/other]

**Usage Patterns in Your Project:**
- Percentage of proofs that use `simp`: [estimate: <10% / 10-30% / 30-50% / >50%]
- Typical `simp` usage: [`by simp` / `simp [specific_rules]` / `simp_rw` / mixed]
- Slowest compilation bottleneck: [simp search / type checking / other tactics / file size]

**Results Summary:**
- **Compilation time improvement:** [X% faster/slower/no change]
- **Most improved file:** [filename] - [X% improvement]
- **Any files that got slower:** [Yes/No] - [details if yes]
- **Overall satisfaction:** [Very satisfied/Satisfied/Neutral/Dissatisfied/Very dissatisfied]
