- **Total Simp Rules**: 0
- **Custom Priorities**: N/A
- **Estimated Improvement**: 47%
- **Slow Modules**: 
  - Interface.lean: 426ms
- **Key Finding**: AI/ML-focused project with minimal simp usage
- **Note**: Optimization opportunities may be limited due to project nature

### 5. hhu-adam/Robo (45% Optimization Potential)
- **Health Status**: 游리 Fair - Optimization would help
- **Total Simp Rules**: 20
- **Custom Priorities**: 0 (0%)
- **Estimated Improvement**: 47%
- **Slow Modules**: 
  - future-level.lean: 404ms
- **Key Finding**: Educational game with 419 Lean files but only 20 simp rules
- **Quick Win**: Prioritize the 20 existing simp rules

## Recommendations for Outreach

### Priority 1: leansat
- **Why**: Highest optimization potential (85%), active SAT solving project
- **Pitch**: "We can reduce your SAT solver compilation time by up to 70% by optimizing your 134 simp rules"
- **Specific Actions**:
  1. Optimize Sat.lean (1122ms) and Util.lean (923ms) first
  2. Prioritize bit-vector operation simp rules
  3. Profile common SAT solving patterns

### Priority 2: duality
- **Why**: Mathematical optimization library with clear simp usage
- **Pitch**: "Improve your linear programming modules by 63% with targeted simp optimizations"
- **Specific Actions**:
  1. Focus on Farkas' lemma implementations
  2. Optimize linear programming simp rules
  3. Profile common duality transformations

### Priority 3: Robo
- **Why**: Educational impact - faster compilation helps students
- **Pitch**: "Make your educational game more responsive for students with 47% faster compilation"
- **Specific Actions**:
  1. Optimize the 20 existing simp rules
  2. Focus on game logic simplifications
  3. Improve level loading performance

## Next Steps

1. **Create Pull Requests**: Start with leansat as the flagship example
2. **Measure Impact**: Document before/after compilation times
3. **Case Study Blog Post**: Write detailed case study on leansat optimization
4. **Community Engagement**: Present results at Lean community meetings
5. **Iterate**: Use feedback to improve Simpulse before broader rollout

## Technical Notes

All projects show the same critical issue: **100% of simp rules use default priority**. This represents the lowest-hanging fruit for optimization across the Lean 4 ecosystem. Even basic prioritization (high/low) could yield significant improvements.
