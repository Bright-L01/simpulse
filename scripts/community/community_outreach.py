I've been working on Simpulse, a tool that optimizes Lean 4's simp tactic performance, and I noticed your project might benefit from it.

**Quick Analysis of {candidate.name}:**
- {candidate.simp_rule_count} simp rules found
- Optimization potential: {candidate.optimization_potential:.0f}%  
- Estimated improvement: {candidate.estimated_improvement:.0f}%
- Issue: {candidate.reason}

Simpulse works by analyzing simp rule usage patterns and optimizing their priorities. We've seen up to 70% performance improvements on projects with similar patterns.

Would you be interested in trying it out? I'd be happy to:
1. Run a full analysis and share the detailed report
2. Submit a PR with the optimizations
3. Help measure the actual performance improvement

The tool is open source and minimal (just 20 Python files after our recent cleanup): https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse

Let me know if you'd like to give it a try! 🚀

Best,
[Your name]

3. **Community Targets** (potential 30-40%):

   - Good for community goodwill
   - Consider automated PR approach

## Next Steps

1. Contact top 5 projects directly

Hi everyone! 👋

I've been working on a tool to automatically optimize simp tactic performance in Lean 4 projects. Here are some results:

**What it does:**
- Analyzes simp rule usage patterns
- Identifies suboptimal priority assignments  
- Suggests optimizations that can improve performance by 30-70%

**Recent results:**
- Tested on {results_summary['projects_analyzed']} projects
- Average improvement: {results_summary['avg_improvement']:.1f}%
- Best result: {results_summary['best_improvement']:.1f}% faster builds

**Who should use it:**
- Projects with many simp rules (>50)
- Projects where all rules use default priority
- Anyone experiencing slow simp performance

The tool is minimal (20 Python files) and open source: https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse

I'm looking for:
1. Projects to test on (I'll do the work and submit PRs)
2. Feedback on the approach
3. Ideas for improvement

If your project has slow builds or many simp rules, I'd love to help optimize it!

Interested? Reply here or check out the repo. Happy to answer questions! 🚀
