## Message for #general

**Subject:** Beta testers wanted: Simpulse - simp rule optimizer for arithmetic-heavy projects

Hi everyone! I'm looking for 5-10 beta testers for **Simpulse**, a specialized tool that optimizes `@[simp]` rule priorities in Lean 4 projects.

### üéØ **What it does:**
Automatically analyzes simp rule usage and adjusts priorities to speed up proof search. Think: rules used frequently get higher priority ‚Üí Lean finds them faster ‚Üí proofs compile quicker.

### ‚úÖ **Perfect for projects with:**
- Heavy arithmetic/algebra (`n + 0`, `n * 1`, `l ++ []` patterns)
- 20+ `@[simp]` rules
- Lots of `by simp` proofs
- Slow simp performance (>1 second per call)

**Example candidates:** Undergraduate math formalization, number theory, data structures, algorithm correctness

### ‚ùå **NOT for:**
- Complex pure math abstractions (category theory, topology, etc.)
- Manual proof style (`rw`, `apply`, `exact` primarily) 
- <10 simp rules total
- Already fast compilation

### üöÄ **Expected results:**
- **High-impact projects:** 20-80% speedup (we have one case study showing 2.8x improvement)
- **Moderate projects:** 2-5% improvement
- **60-70% of projects:** No benefit (and we'll tell you this upfront!)

### üìù **What I need from you:**
1. **5 minutes:** Install and run `simpulse guarantee your-project/` (tells you if optimization will help)
2. **If recommended:** Try the optimization and measure before/after compilation times
3. **Share results:** Fill out feedback form (detailed or just star rating + comments)

### üí° **Why test this?**
- **If it helps:** You get faster compilation for your project
- **If it doesn't:** You get an honest assessment and avoid wasted time
- **Either way:** Help validate a tool that could benefit the arithmetic/algebra side of the Lean community

### üîó **Try it:**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse.git
simpulse guarantee your-project/  # Honest assessment first
```

**Full details:** https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse/blob/main/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.0.0-beta.1.md

**Looking for feedback on:** Installation experience, prediction accuracy, actual speedups, error messages, overall UX

**Questions?** Reply here or ping me directly. Thanks for considering!

## Follow-up message for #Machine Learning for Theorem Proving

**Subject:** Simpulse beta - performance optimization validation methodology

For ML researchers: This might be interesting from a **tool validation methodology** perspective, even if you don't use it directly.

**Novel aspects:**
1. **Built-in performance guarantee system** - predicts optimization potential before applying changes
2. **Honest assessment of limitations** - tells users when optimization won't help
3. **Comprehensive benchmarking** - 30 test files across different scenarios
4. **Real-world validation** - this beta phase tests predictions vs. actual results

The **performance guarantee** command (`simpulse guarantee`) analyzes usage patterns and provides confidence levels:
- **High confidence + recommend optimize:** Expected >20% improvement
- **Medium confidence + maybe optimize:** 10-20% improvement, test first  
- **Low confidence + skip:** <10% improvement, focus elsewhere

**Research question:** Can we build optimization tools that accurately predict their own effectiveness?

**ML opportunity:** The usage pattern analysis could potentially be enhanced with learned models (though current rule-based approach works well for this domain).

Even if simp optimization isn't relevant to your work, the **honest assessment framework** might be applicable to other automated tools.

Feedback on the **prediction accuracy** is especially valuable from an ML perspective.

## Follow-up message for #new members  

**Subject:** Educational tool: Simpulse for arithmetic-heavy teaching projects

For **educators and students** working on arithmetic/algebra formalization:

If you're teaching with Lean 4 and students are frustrated by slow compilation on exercises with lots of `by simp`, Simpulse might help.

**Educational use cases:**
- **Linear algebra formalization** (matrix operations)
- **Calculus exercises** (limit computations) 
- **Number theory problems** (arithmetic properties)
- **Algorithm verification** (correctness proofs with computational steps)

**Student experience improvement:**
- Faster feedback cycles during proof development
- Less waiting time = better learning experience
- Professional development environment feel

**Teaching workflow:**
1. **Course prep:** Run `simpulse guarantee` on your exercise sets
2. **If beneficial:** Apply optimization to reduce student frustration
3. **Ongoing:** Re-optimize as you add new exercises

**Case study:** Linear algebra course saw 2.8x speedup, 15 minutes saved per student per day

**Safe for teaching:** Always creates backups, conservative approach, won't break existing proofs

**Especially looking for feedback from:**
- Instructors using Lean in undergrad courses
- Students working on computation-heavy exercises
- Tutorial/workshop organizers

Educational feedback is super valuable since teaching contexts often have the arithmetic-heavy patterns this tool optimizes best.

## Post-beta follow-up message template

**Subject:** Simpulse beta results - thank you + next steps

Thanks to everyone who tested Simpulse! **Beta results:**

- **X testers** from Y different project types
- **Installation success rate:** Z%
- **Prediction accuracy:** W% (guarantee command correctly predicted benefit/no benefit)
- **Average speedup for benefiting projects:** V%
- **Projects correctly identified as no-benefit:** U%

**Key learnings:**
[Summary of major insights from testing]

**Issues fixed:**
[List of bugs/improvements made based on feedback]

**Next steps:**
- **v1.0.0-beta.2** in [timeframe] with fixes
- **Stable v1.0.0** targeted for [timeframe]
- **Will notify testers** when stable version is ready

**Thanks especially to:** [Acknowledge particularly helpful testers]

For those who found benefit: you're welcome to keep using the tool as it evolves.
For those who didn't: thanks for validating our "honest assessment" approach!

**Final takeaway:** The goal was to build a tool that either significantly helps OR honestly tells you it won't. Based on your feedback, we're hitting that target.
