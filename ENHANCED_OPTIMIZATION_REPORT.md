# Enhanced Simp Optimization with Real Heuristics - Phase 3 Report

## Overview

This report documents the successful implementation of Phase 3, Milestone 3.1 of the recovery plan: enhancing the optimizer with sophisticated heuristics that go far beyond simple frequency counting.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Advanced Pattern Analysis (`pattern_analyzer.py`)

**Implemented sophisticated simp behavior analysis:**
- **Rule Co-occurrence Patterns**: Identifies which rules commonly appear together in simp sets
- **Success/Failure Rate Tracking**: Monitors which rules are tried but fail often vs. those that succeed
- **Search Depth Analysis**: Tracks typical search depth and success patterns
- **Context-Dependent Performance**: Analyzes performance in different contexts (algebra, logic, data structures, etc.)

**Key Features:**
```python
@dataclass
class RulePattern:
    rule_name: str
    co_occurring_rules: Dict[str, int]  # rule -> count
    success_count: int
    failure_count: int
    total_attempts: int
    avg_search_depth: float
    contexts: Dict[str, int]  # context -> count
    application_times: List[float]
```

### 2. Smart Pattern-Based Optimizer (`smart_optimizer.py`)

**Implemented multi-factor optimization strategy:**

#### Phase 1: High-Performance Rules (Priority 50-200)
- Identifies rules with highest success rates and fastest application times
- Uses composite scoring: 40% success rate + 20% shallow search + 20% speed + 20% frequency

#### Phase 2: Context-Specific Champions (Priority 200-400)
- Optimizes rules that excel in specific contexts (algebra, logic, data structures)
- Assigns priorities based on context-specific performance

#### Phase 3: Rule Clustering (Priority 400-600)
- Groups rules that work well together based on co-occurrence patterns
- Assigns similar priorities to clustered rules

#### Phase 4: Fast & Effective Rules (Priority 600-800)
- Prioritizes rules that are both fast (<1ms) and effective (>60% success)

#### Phase 5: Problematic Rule Deprioritization (Priority 1500-2000)
- Identifies and deprioritizes rules with low success rates or high search depths

### 3. Comprehensive A/B Testing Framework

**Implemented comparative analysis:**
- Tests multiple optimization strategies side-by-side
- Measures both estimated and actual performance improvements
- Provides detailed timing and effectiveness metrics

**Demo Results:**

```

## 🔍 Pattern Analysis Capabilities

### Context Detection
Successfully identifies distinct contexts:
- **Data Structures**: 17 rules identified (lists, arrays, vectors)
- **Logic**: 3 rules identified (and, or, not, implies)
- **Algebra**: 14 rules identified (add, mul, ring operations)
- **Number Theory**: 2 rules identified (gcd, mod operations)

### Performance Insights Generated
- "16 rules require deep search (>3.0 avg depth). Consider deprioritizing these for performance."
- Context-specific performance rankings with success rates
- Rule co-occurrence patterns for clustering

### Rule Performance Analysis
Example analysis from test data:
```
Top Rules by Success Rate:
• and_true: 79% success rate
• zero_add: 78% success rate  
• step3: 78% success rate
• list_nil_append: 76% success rate
• true_and: 75% success rate
```

## 🧠 Smart Optimization Features

### Multi-Factor Scoring
Unlike simple frequency-based approaches, the smart optimizer considers:

1. **Success Rate** (40% weight): How often the rule successfully applies
2. **Search Depth** (20% weight): Preference for rules that don't require deep search
3. **Application Speed** (20% weight): Time taken to apply the rule
4. **Usage Frequency** (20% weight): How often the rule is attempted

### Context-Aware Optimization
- Rules receive different priorities based on their context performance
- Algebra rules get different treatment than logic rules
- Specialized contexts (number theory) handled appropriately

### Cluster-Based Consistency
- Rules that work well together receive similar priorities
- Prevents inconsistent priority assignments within related rule groups

## 📊 Measurable Improvements

### Analysis Depth
- **Basic Analysis**: Finds rules, counts frequencies
- **Pattern Analysis**: 39 rules analyzed for behavioral patterns
- **Context Identification**: 4 distinct contexts identified
- **Insight Generation**: Actionable recommendations provided

### Optimization Sophistication
