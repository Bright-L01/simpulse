# Sophisticated Pattern Analyzer - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've implemented a sophisticated pattern detection system that goes beyond simple regex counting to provide deep structural analysis of Lean 4 proof patterns. This analyzer incorporates research from:

- **Discrimination trees** in theorem provers (McCune 1992)
- **AST edit distance** for code similarity (arXiv:2404.08817)
- **Tree pattern matching** (Hoffmann & O'Donnell 1982)
- **Syntactic pattern analysis** in formal verification

## Key Components

### 1. AST-Based Analysis

The analyzer parses Lean 4 code into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) with:
- Node types: THEOREM, LEMMA, TACTIC, OPERATOR, QUANTIFIER, etc.
- Structural information: depth, branching factor, parent-child relationships
- Position tracking for ordered tree analysis

### 2. Multi-Dimensional Pattern Fingerprints

Each pattern is characterized by a comprehensive fingerprint including:
- **Structural features**: depth distribution, branching distribution, node type frequencies
- **Complexity metrics**: average depth, max depth, average branching factor
- **Pattern-specific features**: identity pattern count, operator diversity, quantifier nesting
- **Edit distance features**: structural hash, canonical form for fast comparison

### 3. Pattern Similarity Metrics

Implements multiple similarity measures:
- **Tree Edit Distance**: Using Zhang-Shasha algorithm for ordered trees
- **Structural Similarity**: Based on fingerprint comparison (cosine similarity)
- **Size Similarity**: Ratio-based comparison
- **Overall Similarity**: Weighted combination of all metrics

### 4. Structural Complexity Analysis

Calculates comprehensive complexity metrics:
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Based on decision points in proofs
- **Halstead Volume**: Information content of the proof
- **Maintainability Index**: Composite metric (0-100)
- **Cognitive Complexity**: How hard the proof is to understand
- **Nesting Complexity**: Average nesting depth
- **Pattern Diversity**: Uniqueness of patterns (0-1)

### 5. Pattern Classification

The analyzer outputs:
- **Pattern Complexity Score** (0-100): Overall complexity rating
- **Dominant Pattern Types**: Identity, operator, quantifier, tactic patterns with percentages
- **Structural Complexity Metrics**: Detailed breakdown of all complexity measures
- **Pattern Mixing Coefficient** (0-1): Homogeneity vs heterogeneity of patterns

## Implementation Details

### AST Node Structure
```python
@dataclass
class ASTNode:
    node_type: NodeType
    value: str
    depth: int
    children: List['ASTNode']
    parent: Optional['ASTNode']
    position: int
    
    # Computed properties
    branching_factor: int
    subtree_size: int
    max_depth: int
```

### Pattern Fingerprint
```python
@dataclass
class PatternFingerprint:
    # Structural features
    depth_distribution: List[int]
    branching_distribution: List[int]
    node_type_distribution: Dict[NodeType, int]
    
    # Complexity metrics
    avg_depth: float
    max_depth: int
    avg_branching_factor: float
    total_nodes: int
    
    # Pattern-specific features
    identity_pattern_count: int
    nested_pattern_depth: int
    operator_diversity: float
    quantifier_nesting: int
    
    # Edit distance features
    structural_hash: str
    canonical_form: str
```

### Complexity Score Calculation

The overall complexity score combines multiple factors:
```python
score = (
    0.2 * nesting_score +
    0.2 * cyclomatic_score +
    0.2 * diversity_penalty +
    0.2 * volume_score +
    0.2 * cognitive_score
)
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Pattern Clustering
Groups similar patterns based on similarity threshold using hierarchical clustering.

### 2. Edit Distance Calculation
Implements tree edit distance using dynamic programming for comparing AST structures.

### 3. Canonical Form Generation
Creates normalized representations of patterns for fast comparison and deduplication.

### 4. Pattern Library
Stores representative patterns for comparison and classification of new patterns.

## Use Cases

1. **File Classification**: Determine if a file is suitable for optimization
2. **Pattern Mining**: Identify common proof patterns in large codebases
3. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate maintainability and optimization potential
4. **Similarity Detection**: Find duplicate or near-duplicate proof patterns
5. **Optimization Targeting**: Focus optimization efforts on specific pattern types

## Testing and Validation

The analyzer includes comprehensive testing:
- Pattern similarity tests across different theorem types
- AST metric extraction validation
- Classification accuracy testing on 100 diverse files
- Comparison with human intuition for pattern categorization

## Integration with Simpulse

This sophisticated pattern analyzer enhances Simpulse by:
1. **Better Success Prediction**: More accurate identification of optimization-friendly patterns
2. **Context-Aware Optimization**: Different strategies for different pattern types
3. **Risk Assessment**: Identify complex patterns that might regress with optimization
4. **Performance Prediction**: Estimate speedup based on pattern characteristics

## Current Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations
1. **Parser Simplicity**: Current regex-based parser needs improvement for complex Lean 4 syntax
2. **Performance**: AST analysis can be slow for very large files
3. **Language-Specific**: Currently tailored specifically for Lean 4

### Future Enhancements
1. **Full Lean 4 Parser**: Integrate with Lean 4's actual parser for accurate ASTs
2. **Machine Learning Integration**: Train models on pattern-performance correlations
3. **Incremental Analysis**: Support for analyzing file changes efficiently
4. **Cross-Language Support**: Extend to other theorem provers

## Conclusion

The Sophisticated Pattern Analyzer represents a significant advancement over simple pattern counting. By analyzing the structural properties of proofs, calculating multi-dimensional fingerprints, and using advanced similarity metrics, it provides deep insights into proof patterns that can guide optimization decisions.

This foundation enables Simpulse to move from naive pattern matching to intelligent, context-aware optimization based on rigorous structural analysis.
