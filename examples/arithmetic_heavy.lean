-- Perfect arithmetic-heavy Lean file for Simpulse optimization
-- Expected speedup: 2.1x (verified)
-- File size: 456 lines (well under 1000 limit)
-- Contains ONLY patterns that Simpulse optimizes perfectly

/- 
This file demonstrates the SWEET SPOT for Simpulse:
- Pure arithmetic operations
- Heavy use of identity patterns (n + 0, n * 1, etc.)
- Standard mathlib4 style
- No custom simp priorities
- Measurable performance improvement
