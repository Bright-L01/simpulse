# üéØ Simpulse Success Patterns

*An honest analysis of what works, what doesn't, and why users should (or shouldn't) trust our numbers*

## üìä The Real Numbers

From our performance gallery testing 50 Lean 4 files:

| Metric | Value | What It Means |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Tests Run** | 50 | Diverse code patterns tested |
| **Failed Completely** | 20 (40%) | Couldn't even compile baseline |
| **Successful Tests** | 30 (60%) | Compiled and measured |
| **Actually Improved** | 15 (30%) | Got faster with optimization |
| **Made Things Worse** | 15 (30%) | Got slower with optimization |
| **Best Speedup** | 2.59x | Exceptional case |
| **Average Speedup** | 1.09x | Includes harmful cases |
| **Median Speedup** | 0.98x | Half the tests got slower |

## üèÜ Where Simpulse Succeeds

### 1. Arithmetic-Heavy Code
```lean
-- These patterns see 1.3x - 2.6x speedup
theorem arith_complex : (n + 0) * (1 * m) = n * m := by simp
theorem nested_arith : ((n + 0) + 0) * 1 = n := by simp
```

**Why it works**: 
- Arithmetic operations like `n + 0` and `n * 1` are extremely common
- Default Lean searches through 1000+ lemmas at priority 1000
- Our optimization puts these at priority 1200, finding them immediately
- Cascade effect: Each faster simp makes subsequent simplifications faster

### 2. Definition-Based Proofs
```lean
-- Consistent 1.1x - 2.1x speedup
def double (n : Nat) : Nat := n + n
theorem double_zero : double 0 = 0 := by simp [double]
```

**Why it works**:
- Definitions often expand to arithmetic operations
- Unfolding definitions creates opportunities for our optimized lemmas
- More consistent results than other categories

### 3. Longer-Running Computations
- Files with baseline >0.5s see better improvements
- Files with baseline <0.4s often get worse
- Suggests optimization overhead is fixed, so longer runs amortize better

## üö´ Where Simpulse Fails

### 1. List Operations
```lean
-- Average 0.95x "speedup" (actually 5% slower)
theorem list_ops : l ++ [] = l := by simp
```

**Why it fails**:
- List lemmas aren't in our optimization set
- Adding priority declarations creates overhead
- Native Lean already optimizes these well

### 2. Fast Operations (<0.4s)
- Optimization overhead exceeds benefits
- These operations are already efficient
- Our changes add compilation overhead without enough benefit

### 3. Logic and Tactics
- 100% failure rate in testing
- These categories use different simp strategies
- Our arithmetic-focused optimization doesn't help

## üîç The Honest Pattern Analysis

### What Really Happens

1. **Best Case (2.59x speedup)**:
   - Heavy arithmetic with multiple `n + 0` and `n * 1` operations
   - Simp tries our lemmas first instead of searching through 1000+ options
   - Dramatic improvement in search time

2. **Typical Case (0.98x median)**:
   - Mixed operations without heavy arithmetic
   - Optimization overhead without matching benefits
   - Slightly slower than baseline

3. **Worst Case (0.65x - 35% slower)**:
   - List-heavy operations
   - Our optimization interferes with Lean's built-in optimizations
   - Significant performance regression

### The Brutal Truth

**Our optimization is a scalpel, not a sledgehammer:**

‚úÖ **Use Simpulse when:**
- Your code has heavy arithmetic operations
- You see lots of `n + 0`, `n * 1`, `p ‚àß True` patterns
- Compilation takes >1 second
- You can test and measure the impact

‚ùå **Avoid Simpulse when:**
- Working primarily with lists, sets, or complex data structures
- Your code already compiles quickly (<0.5s)
- You can't tolerate any performance regression
- You need consistent results across all code patterns

## üìà Why Users Should (Cautiously) Trust These Numbers

### 1. Real Measurements
```python
# We measure actual compilation time, not simulations
result = subprocess.run(["lean", str(lean_file)], ...)
compilation_time = end_time - start_time
```

### 2. Honest Reporting
- We show when optimization makes things worse
- We report the 40% failure rate
- We don't hide the 0.98x median (most tests get slower)

### 3. Reproducible Results
```bash
# Users can verify with:
time lean YourFile.lean  # Before
# Add our optimization
time lean YourFile.lean  # After
```

### 4. Clear Patterns
- Arithmetic ‚Üí Good results
- Lists ‚Üí Bad results
- Fast code ‚Üí Often gets worse
- Slow code ‚Üí Often improves

## üéØ The Success Formula

**Simpulse works best when:**

1. **High arithmetic density**: >30% of operations are basic arithmetic
2. **Longer compilation**: >0.5s baseline compilation time
3. **Simple proofs**: Using `by simp` extensively
4. **Measurable hotspots**: You've profiled and found simp bottlenecks

**Success likelihood by category:**

| Category | Success Rate | Avg Speedup | Recommendation |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| Arithmetic | 80% | 1.30x | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| Definitions | 100% | 1.27x | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| Structures | 100% | 1.05x | ‚ö†Ô∏è Test first |
| Functions | 100% | 1.02x | ‚ö†Ô∏è Marginal benefit |
| Conditionals | 100% | 0.98x | ‚ùå Avoid |
| Lists | 100% | 0.95x | ‚ùå Avoid |

## üèÅ Conclusion: A Tool, Not Magic

Simpulse is **not** a universal optimizer. It's a targeted tool that:

1. **Excels** at optimizing arithmetic-heavy Lean code (up to 2.6x speedup)
2. **Struggles** with list operations and fast code (up to 35% slower)
3. **Requires** measurement and testing for each use case
4. **Delivers** real, measurable improvements in specific scenarios

### The Bottom Line

**Trust our numbers because:**
- They're real measurements, not estimates
- We show both successes and failures
- The pattern is clear: arithmetic good, lists bad
- You can reproduce results yourself

**But verify because:**
- Your code might not match our test patterns
- 50% of our "successful" tests got slower
- Performance is highly dependent on code structure
- One size definitely doesn't fit all

### Final Recommendation

```lean
-- Try Simpulse if your code looks like this:
theorem math_heavy : (a + 0) * (b * 1) + (c + 0) = a * b + c := by simp

-- Avoid Simpulse if your code looks like this:
theorem list_heavy : (l‚ÇÅ ++ l‚ÇÇ) ++ [] = l‚ÇÅ ++ l‚ÇÇ := by simp
```

**Measure twice, optimize once.**

*Remember: A 2.6x speedup on the right code is worth more than a universal 1.1x that makes half your code slower.*
