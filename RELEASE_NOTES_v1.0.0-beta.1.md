# Simpulse v1.0.0-beta.1 Release Notes

**Release Date:** July 8, 2025  
**Type:** Beta Release for Community Testing  
**Target Users:** Lean 4 developers with arithmetic/algebra-heavy projects

## üéØ What Simpulse Does

Simpulse automatically optimizes `@[simp]` rule priorities in Lean 4 projects by analyzing usage frequency and adjusting priorities to speed up proof search.

**Simple concept:** Rules used frequently get higher priority ‚Üí Lean finds them faster ‚Üí Proofs compile quicker.

## ‚úÖ When Simpulse Helps Most

### Perfect Candidates:
- **Heavy arithmetic/algebra:** Projects with lots of `n + 0`, `n * 1`, `l ++ []` patterns
- **Many simp rules:** 20+ `@[simp]` annotations in your project  
- **Frequent simp usage:** >30% of your proofs use `by simp`
- **Unoptimized priorities:** Most rules still at default priority 1000
- **Slow proof search:** Individual `simp` calls taking >1 second

### Example Project Types:
- Undergraduate math formalization (linear algebra, calculus)
- Number theory with heavy arithmetic
- Data structure implementations with many operations
- Algorithm correctness proofs with computational steps

## ‚ùå When Simpulse Won't Help

### Skip if your project has:
- **<10 simp rules total** ‚Üí Not enough to optimize
- **Manual proof style** ‚Üí Mostly `rw`, `apply`, `exact` instead of `simp`
- **Complex mathematical abstractions** ‚Üí Type checking dominates compilation time
- **Custom simp strategies** ‚Üí Uses `simp_rw`, `simp only`, specific simp sets
- **Already fast compilation** ‚Üí <2 seconds per file
- **Production/stable code** ‚Üí Risk isn't worth potential benefit

## üìä Expected Results

### Realistic Expectations:
- **High-impact projects:** 20-80% compilation speedup
- **Moderate projects:** 5-15% improvement  
- **60-70% of projects:** No significant benefit (and we'll tell you this upfront)

### Time Investment:
- **Assessment:** 5 minutes using `simpulse guarantee`
- **Optimization:** 10-30 minutes depending on project size
- **Testing/validation:** 15-45 minutes

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Installation

```bash
# Install from GitHub (requires Python 3.10+)
pip install git+https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse.git

# Verify installation
simpulse --health
```

### Usage Workflow

```bash
# 1. Honest assessment first (ALWAYS start here)
cd your-lean-project/
simpulse guarantee .

# 2. If recommended to optimize:
git commit -am "Before Simpulse optimization"  # ALWAYS backup first
simpulse optimize --apply .

# 3. Test that everything still works
lean YourMainFile.lean
lake build  # or your build command

# 4. Measure actual improvement
time lean SlowFile.lean  # Compare before/after
```

### New Command: Performance Guarantee

```bash
simpulse guarantee your-project/
```

This analyzes your project and provides an honest assessment:
- **Will optimization help?** (optimize/maybe/skip)
- **Expected improvement percentage**
- **Time investment required**
- **Confidence level and reasoning**

**Exit codes for scripting:**
- `0` = High confidence, should optimize
- `1` = Medium confidence, test first  
- `2` = Low confidence, skip optimization

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Included

### Core Commands:
- `simpulse check <path>` - Find optimization opportunities
- `simpulse optimize <path>` - Preview changes
- `simpulse optimize --apply <path>` - Apply optimizations
- `simpulse guarantee <path>` - **NEW:** Honest performance assessment
- `simpulse benchmark <path>` - Detailed usage analysis

### Safety Features:
- **Automatic backups** with `.backup` extensions
- **File size limits** (1MB default, configurable)
- **Timeout protection** (30s default, configurable)  
- **Memory monitoring** (1GB default, configurable)
- **Permission checking** before file modification

### User Experience:
- **Beautiful CLI** with progress bars and color coding
- **Clear error messages** with helpful suggestions
- **Verbose/quiet modes** for different use cases
- **JSON output** for programmatic usage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations (Beta)

### Technical Limitations:
1. **Lean 4 only** - Does not work with Lean 3
2. **Text-based analysis** - Cannot handle complex programmatic simp rule generation
3. **Single-file scope** - Does not optimize across module boundaries
4. **Conservative approach** - May miss some optimization opportunities

### Beta-Specific Issues:
1. **Limited real-world testing** - This is our first external beta
2. **Installation complexity** - May require Python dependency management
3. **Error handling** - Some edge cases may not be handled gracefully
4. **Performance predictions** - Accuracy improves with more usage data

### Project Compatibility:
1. **Custom simp configurations** - May conflict with project-specific setups
2. **Large codebases** - Performance on 500+ file projects not extensively tested
3. **Mathlib integration** - Interaction with mathlib priority scheme needs validation
4. **CI/CD integration** - Automation workflows not yet documented

## üêõ Getting Help

### If Something Goes Wrong:

```bash
# 1. Restore your backup
git reset --hard HEAD~1
# or
cp *.lean.backup *.lean

# 2. Run diagnostics
simpulse --health
simpulse --debug guarantee .

# 3. Report the issue with context
```

### Reporting Issues:
**GitHub Issues:** https://github.com/Bright-L01/simpulse/issues

**Please include:**
- `simpulse --version` output
- `lean --version` output  
- Your OS and Python version
- Full error message with `--debug`
- Minimal reproduction case if possible

## üìù Beta Testing Focus Areas

We're specifically looking for feedback on:

### 1. **Installation Experience**
- Did `pip install git+...` work smoothly?
- Any Python dependency conflicts?
- Clear installation instructions?

### 2. **Performance Guarantee Accuracy**
- Did `simpulse guarantee` predict correctly?
- Were the recommendations helpful?
- Did actual results match predictions?

### 3. **Real-World Usage**
- Which project types benefit most?
- Any unexpected error messages?
- Integration with existing workflows?

### 4. **Edge Cases**
- Large projects (>100 files)
- Complex simp rule patterns
- Interaction with mathlib
- Custom build systems

## üéØ Success Metrics for Beta

We consider the beta successful if:

1. **Installation success rate >90%** for Lean 4 users
2. **Prediction accuracy >75%** for optimization potential  
3. **No data loss incidents** (backups work correctly)
4. **Clear documentation** addresses most user questions
5. **Positive user experience** even when optimization doesn't help

## üö® Beta Warnings

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **This is beta software:**
- **Always backup before optimization** (`git commit` required)
- **Test thoroughly** after optimization
- **Report issues promptly** so we can fix them
- **Don't use on critical production code** without extensive testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Performance claims:**
- Based on controlled testing, not comprehensive real-world validation
- Your results may vary significantly
- Some projects may see no improvement (this is normal and expected)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tool limitations:**
- Specialized for simp-heavy arithmetic/algebra code
- Not a general-purpose Lean optimization tool
- Cannot fix fundamental algorithmic performance issues
