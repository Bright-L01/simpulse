2. **Simulated Components:**
   - Compilation time measurements (based on realistic distributions)
   - Performance improvements (derived from strategy effectiveness models)
   - Success rates (grounded in theoretical analysis)

3. **Validation:**
   - Results consistent with Thompson Sampling regret bounds
   - Performance patterns match theoretical predictions
   - Strategy selection follows expected contextual patterns
