-- Example simp rules that would be optimized

@[simp] theorem example_rule2 (n : Nat) : 0 + n = n := by simp
@[simp] theorem example_rule3 (n : Nat) : n * 1 = n := by simp
@[simp] theorem example_rule4 (n : Nat) : 1 * n = n := by simp

-- Example theorem that uses simp
theorem test_theorem (a b c : Nat) : (a + 0) * 1 + (0 + b) * (c * 1) = a + b * c := by
  simp

-- To use Simpulse optimization:
-- 1. Run Python analysis to generate optimization file
-- 2. Apply optimizations using the command:
-- #simpulse_apply "./optimizations.json"

-- Example of what the optimization file might contain:
